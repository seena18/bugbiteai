## YOLOv5 Classification Tutorial

YOLOv5 supports classification tasks too. This is the official YOLOv5 classification notebook tutorial. YOLOv5 is maintained by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

This notebook covers:

*   Inference with out-of-the-box YOLOv5 classification on ImageNet
*  [Training YOLOv5 classification](https://blog.roboflow.com//train-YOLOv5-classification-custom-data) on custom data

*Looking for custom data? Explore over 66M community datasets on [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com).*

This notebook was created with Google Colab. [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FiSNz9f_nT8aFtDEU3iDAQKlPT8SCVni?usp=sharing) to run it.

Here, we use the DATASET_NAME environment variable to pass our dataset to the `--data` parameter.

Note: we're training for 100 epochs here. We're also starting training from the pretrained weights. Larger datasets will likely benefit from longer training.
